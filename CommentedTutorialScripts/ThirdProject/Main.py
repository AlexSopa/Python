#TO-DO 
#Attempt to perfect knowledge of Calculus & different functions used in Machine Learning
#Apply knowledge in python using NumPy & MatplotLib to graph & better my understanding
#Create my own Neural network without using pre-made NN libraries(Keras)
#Apply changes & challenge the network to get the accuracy high & false positives low
#--Maybe do something with this & Twitter API
