#Plan
#Follow https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-for-beginners-an-introduction-to-neural-networks-d49f22d238f9 for guided learning
#Use knowledge from https://www.3blue1brown.com/neural-networks 

#TO-DO
#Broaden knowledge of Calculus used in Machine Learning
#Apply knowledge in python using NumPy & MatplotLib to graph & better my understanding
#Create my own Neural network without using pre-made NN libraries(Keras)
#Apply changes & challenge the network to get the accuracy high & false positives low
#--Maybe do something with this & Twitter API
